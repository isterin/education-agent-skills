## Who This Is For

- **Classroom teachers** who want evidence-based lesson and assessment design without hours of research
- **University lecturers and professors** who received little or no teacher training and want practical, research-grounded support for their teaching
- **Curriculum designers and heads of learning** building programmes, units, and assessments
- **School leaders in innovative and alternative education contexts** — international schools, Montessori, project-based, democratic and nature-based schools
- **Innovators reimagining education** — people building new school models, alternative programmes, and next-generation learning environments. Evidence-based constraints don't limit creative redesign of education; they deepen it.
- **EdTech developers and AI builders** who need a structured, programmatically accessible education knowledge layer
- **Education researchers** interested in how evidence translates into AI-mediated practice

## Why This Exists

AI is arriving in education fast. Whether it improves learning outcomes or simply scales mediocre practice depends almost entirely on what it is built on.

Most AI education tools are built on convention, habit, and assumption — on what educators have always done, rather than on what the research says actually works. Learning styles. Rigid lesson structures. Wellbeing programmes disconnected from learning theory. As AI expands in education, so does the risk of scaling ineffective practice.

This library exists to build something different: a credible, rigorous foundation for AI in education. One that is anchored in named research, honest about its limitations, and designed especially for the educators working at the frontier — building the next generation of schools, not optimising existing ones.

The potential is real. Personalised, evidence-grounded learning support at a scale that was never previously possible. But only if what is powering it is the actual evidence.

The benefit is not only personalised learning. It is teaching quality and workload. An educator who would otherwise spend hours researching, designing, and second-guessing gets structured, evidence-grounded support in minutes — which means more time for the parts of teaching that only a human can do.

That is one use case. The same library can power school-wide curriculum audits, personalised professional development pathways for teachers, or orchestrated end-of-term assessment reviews. The skills are the foundation. The architecture below describes the layers that make this possible.

## Using the Library

### CoWork (native plugin — easiest)

Go to **Customize → (+) Add Plugin** and paste the GitHub URL:

```
https://github.com/GarethManning/education-agent-skills
```

CoWork reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and installs all 131 skills automatically.

### Claude.ai or Claude Desktop (via MCP server)

Add the MCP server URL under **Settings → Connectors**:

```
https://mcp-server-sigma-sooty.vercel.app/mcp
```

On first use: click the **+** icon in the message bar → select **Connectors** → find Claude Education Skills and toggle it on. Skills activate automatically in every conversation — no manual activation needed.

### Claude Code (local via npx)

Run the server locally without any account or deployment:

```bash
npx education-agent-skills
```

Or add it permanently to your Claude Code config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "education-agent-skills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["education-agent-skills"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI (plugin)

```
/plugin marketplace add GarethManning/education-agent-skills
/plugin install education-agent-skills
```

Or install directly from the repo URL:

```
claude plugin install https://github.com/GarethManning/education-agent-skills
```

Skills load with progressive disclosure — metadata only until a skill is actually needed.

### Remote MCP (API / programmatic)

```
https://mcp-server-sigma-sooty.vercel.app/mcp
```

## What Changed in v2

The library is now compliant with the **Agent Skills 1.0 open standard**. What this means in practice:

- **One-command install** — no manual setup, no copy-pasting prompts
- **Progressive disclosure** — skill metadata loads first; full skill content loads only when activated, keeping context lean
- **Auto-activation** — skills trigger when your conversation matches their description, without explicit invocation
- **Machine-readable registry** — `registry.json` indexes all skills with descriptions, tags, chaining metadata, and domain grouping for programmatic consumption
- **Backward compatible** — the MCP server, direct prompt use, and all existing workflows continue to work unchanged

---

## Try It Now

### With the plugin (recommended)

Install the plugin, then tell Claude what you need in plain language. The skills activate automatically.

**Example:** Say *"I'm planning a Year 9 science unit on cells — 6 weeks, 3 lessons a week."*

Claude runs the **Backwards Design Unit Planner**, the **Spaced Practice Scheduler**, and the **Retrieval Practice Generator** in parallel. In under 90 seconds you get a complete lesson-by-lesson plan with spaced retrieval built in, evidence-grounded sequencing, and ready-to-use formative assessment activities — all calibrated to the timeline and topic list you provided.

### Without the plugin (manual)

No API key. No technical setup. No dependencies.

1. Open any skill file in the repository (under `skills/`)
2. Copy the prompt block
3. Paste it into Claude and fill in the fields for your class or context

**Example:** Open `skills/memory-learning-science/spaced-practice-scheduler/SKILL.md` and provide:

- Topics: Cell structure, Cell transport, Cell division, Enzymes, Biological molecules
- Timeline: 8-week term, starting 3 February
- Lessons per week: 3

Claude returns a complete week-by-week schedule showing when to teach new content and when to revisit previous topics at expanding intervals — with specific retrieval activities for each review slot. The schedule follows Cepeda et al.'s (2006) meta-analysis on optimal spacing intervals, includes interleaving across topics, and comes with practical guidance on what to do when review reveals gaps.

## Install as Agent Skills

### Claude.ai (MCP server)

Already live at `mcp-server-sigma-sooty.vercel.app/mcp` — add as a custom MCP server in Claude settings under **Settings → Connectors**.

### Claude Code

Clone the repo and add `skills/` to your Claude Code skills path, or symlink individual skills to `~/.claude/skills/`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GarethManning/education-agent-skills.git
```

### OpenAI Codex

Clone the repo. Install as a plugin from the cloned directory, or copy individual skill folders to `~/.codex/skills/` for global access.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GarethManning/education-agent-skills.git
# Copy a skill for global access:
cp -r skills/<domain>/<skill-name> ~/.codex/skills/
```

### Any Agent Skills-compatible tool

Copy skill folders from `skills/` into your agent's skills directory. Each skill follows the open Agent Skills standard (SKILL.md with name/description frontmatter).

## What Makes This Different

**Evidence is the filter — including knowing what to exclude.**
Every skill is grounded in named research: specific authors, specific studies, specific findings. Frameworks that lack empirical support — including learning styles, VAK, and other widely-circulated but poorly-evidenced approaches — are not included. The library documents exactly what was excluded and why in [EXCLUSIONS.md](docs/EXCLUSIONS.md). For any school or faculty trying to separate evidence from convention, that document is worth reading on its own.

**Evidence strength is rated transparently.**

| Rating | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Strong** | Multiple meta-analyses or systematic reviews with consistent findings |
| **Moderate** | Solid experimental evidence with some contextual variation |
| **Emerging** | Promising research base with limited replication or practitioner translation |
| **Original** | Practitioner framework; clearly labelled, not claimed as research-backed |

Where original frameworks are included (Domain 14), they are labelled honestly. One important limitation: the skills encode research-grounded prompts, but the prompts themselves have not been empirically validated as AI interventions. That work is ongoing.

**Built by an educator with 20 years of international school experience.**
The pedagogical judgements embedded in every prompt, every output structure, and every known-limitations section reflect real classroom and curriculum design practice — not a reading of the literature.

**Designed for orchestration from day one.**
YAML schema headers, typed input and output fields, chaining metadata, and composable outputs are built into every skill. This is not a prompt collection with metadata bolted on. It is a skill library engineered for programmatic use.

## Architecture

The library is Layer 1 of a three-layer system. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.

**Layer 1 — Skill Library** (this repository, complete and available now)
131 skills across 17 domains. Each skill encodes a specific, evidence-grounded instructional or curriculum design decision. Works standalone today.

**Layer 2 — Context Engine** *(in design)*
Holds persistent information about students, classes, curriculum sequences, and assessment history. When connected, skill outputs become personalised — not generic advice about retrieval practice, but a specific retrieval schedule for this class based on what they have already learned and been assessed on.

**Layer 3 — Orchestrator** *(in design)*
Allows an educator to state a high-level goal — "Design a 6-week unit on climate change for my Year 8 class" — and receive a complete, personalised plan assembled from multiple skills. The orchestrator proposes; the educator decides.

### For developers: the YAML schema

Every skill opens with a machine-readable header. Here is a real example:

```yaml
---
skill_id: "memory-learning-science/spaced-practice-scheduler"
skill_name: "Spaced Practice Schedule Builder"
domain: "memory-learning-science"
version: "1.0"
evidence_strength: "strong"
evidence_sources:
  - "Cepeda et al. (2006) — Meta-analysis of 254 studies on distributed practice"
  - "Kornell & Bjork (2008) — Spacing and interleaving effects on learning"
  - "Dunlosky et al. (2013) — Distributed practice rated high-utility learning strategy"
input_schema:
  required:
    - field: "topics"
      type: "array"

    - field: "review_activity_suggestions"
      type: "array"
      description: "Specific retrieval activities for each review slot"
    - field: "teacher_guidance"
      type: "string"
      description: "Implementation guidance and how to handle gaps"
chains_well_with:
  - "retrieval-practice-generator"
  - "formative-assessment-technique-selector"
  - "interleaving-unit-planner"

tags: ["spacing", "memory", "planning", "forgetting-curve", "distributed-practice"]
---
```

An orchestrator calls `search_skills("retrieval practice")`, gets back candidates, calls `get_skill` on the best match, and injects the prompt into its workflow.

### MCP Server

The skill library is available as a live MCP server. Any MCP-compatible client can discover, search, and invoke all 111 skills programmatically.

**Production URL:** `https://mcp-server-sigma-sooty.vercel.app/mcp`

Connect from Claude.ai by adding the URL under **Integrations > MCP Servers**. Connect from Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "education-skills": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp-server-sigma-sooty.vercel.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes:
- **135 tools** (131 skills + 4 discovery tools: `list_skills`, `find_skills`, `suggest_skills`, `get_skill_details`)
- **109 prompts** (for clients that surface MCP prompts)

Source code, local setup, and development instructions: [`mcp-server/`](mcp-server/)

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for inclusion criteria. The standard is high intentionally — every skill must be grounded in named evidence, honestly rated, and practically useful. The library's value depends on its rigour.

### Workflow for adding or revising a skill

After creating or editing a `SKILL.md`, run these steps before committing:

```bash
# 1. Regenerate the registry
python3 scripts/generate-registry.py

# 2. Rebuild the MCP server bundle — required after every skill addition or revision
cd mcp-server && npm run bundle-skills && cd ..

# 3. Stage both generated files alongside the skill
git add skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md registry.json mcp-server/src/skills.json
```

**Why the bundle step matters:** the MCP server running on Vercel does not read `SKILL.md` files at deploy time. It serves a pre-built snapshot at `mcp-server/src/skills.json`. If you add or revise a skill without rebuilding the bundle and committing the result, the change will not appear in the live server — even after a Vercel redeploy. CI will catch this and fail the build.
